# Feast for your Beast
A work in progress of a website for a fictional beast sitting service. All those owners of cosmic horror pets and little Cthulhus have to take a break every now and then, and that is where Feast for your Beast comes into play.

Feast for your Beast connects beast owners with completely trustworthy (for real! pinky promise!) beast sitters who will prepare the most amazing feasts for them, clean their containment facilities, provide them with entertainment and generally ensure that your beast has a great time even though you are away.

#### Tech stuff:
I have built a small website before - see [Tenebris scientia](https://github.com/Gjlead/Tenebris-Scientia) - utilizing Python and Jinja. This time I'm trying my hand at C# and the ASP.&#8203;NET with Razor Pages Template.

#### Planned features:
- A way to search for available sitters at your planet of residency and a specific timeslot. The timeslot is chosen via a custom calendar dropdown. I say "custom" because I'm using a slightly simplified version of the [Imperial Dating System](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Dating_System). I'm a little Warhammer nerd, sorry.
- A database containing said sitters, with information about the planets they can provide their service on, their names, a short description and their available timeslots. They even get some basic profile pictures because I'm a sucker for details!
- A way to book a sitter.
- A way to become a sitter yourself - if you have the necessary skills.
- A Privacy Page, because this is a reputable business and we take the privacy of our customers serio-hahaha *stop it* already!
